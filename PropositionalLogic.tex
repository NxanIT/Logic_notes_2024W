\defin{Language of PL}{
The Language \outernote{Language} of Propositional logic is a set containing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item logical symbols: consisting of the \graybf{sentential connective} symbols $\lnot, \land, \lor, \to, \leftrightarrow$ and parenthesis $(,)$
        \item non-logical symbols: $ A_1, A_2,A_3,\dots$ (also called sentential atoms, variables)
    \end{itemize}
    from which we assume (for unique readability) that no symbol is a finite sequence of any other symbols.
}
\note{}{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The role of the logical symbols doesn't change, the sentential atoms we see as variables, they function as placeholders or variables.
        \item we assumed the set of non-logical symbols is countable, for most of our conclusions you could use any set of prop. atoms of any size
    \end{enumerate}

\defin{Expression / prop. sentence}{An \graybf{expression}\outernote{expression}is a any finite sequence of symbols
    We define \graybf{grammatically correct exp.} recursively
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item every prop. atom is a prop. sentence
        \item if $\alpha, \beta$ are prop. sentences, then also $(\lnot \alpha), (\alpha \land \beta), (\alpha \lor \beta), (\alpha \to \beta), (\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta)$
        \item nothing else (in particular $\varnothing$ is not a prop. fla.)
    \end{enumerate}
    and call them \graybf{prop. sentences} or \graybf{prop. fla.}\outernote{prop. fla.}\outernote{prop. sentence}
    Equivalently stated every prop. sentence is built up by applying finitely many formula building operations on atoms and the prop. sent. returned from building operations.

    This allows us to symbolize the \graybf{expression tree} (Here for example for $((\lnot(A_1\to A_2))\lor A_3))$

truth value a given prop. sentence might have.

        Let's assume that for $i\leq k<n$ each $\alpha_i$ is in $S$. Then $\alpha_{k+1}$ is either an atom and therefore in $S$ or its obtained by one of the formula building operations  
        and therefore $\alpha_{k+1}\in S$

\addAbbrev{TA}{truth assignment}
\section{Truth assignments}
%We will answer the question when does a prop. sent. follow from other prop. sentences.
The interpretation of a prop. atom is either true or false, denoted by $0 / 1$ or $T / F$ or $\top / \bot$. 
A truth assigment is simply any map $\nu:S\mapsto \{0,1\}$, where $S$ is a map of propositional atoms. 
Our goal is going to be to extend any truth assigment $v$ to a function $\overline{v}: \overline{S}\mapsto \{0,1\}$, where $\overline{S}$ is the closure
of $S$ under the $5$ fla. building operations. 
\addAbbrev{fla.}{formula}

Let $\{0,1\}$ be the set of truth values. \outernote{Truth assigment} A truth assignment \outernote{TA}(TA) for a set $S$ of prop. atoms is a map $\nu:S\to\{0,1\}$}
We now want to extend $\nu$ to $\overline{\nu}: \overline{S}\to \{0,1\}$, where $\overline{S}$ is the closure of $S$ under the 5 fla. building operations such that
for all propositional atoms $A\in S$ and propositional formulas $\alpha,\beta$ in $\overline{S}$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\overline{\nu}(A) = \nu(A)$ 
    \item $\overline{\nu}(\lnot \alpha) = 1- \nu(\alpha)$ 
    \item $\overline{\nu}(\alpha \land \beta) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{iff } \overline{\nu}(\alpha) = 1 = \overline{\nu}(\beta)\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$
    \item $\overline{\nu}(\alpha \lor \beta) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{iff } \overline{\nu}(\alpha) = 1 \text{ or } \overline{\nu}(\beta) = 1\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}

    \item $\overline{\nu}(\alpha \to \beta) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{iff } \overline{\nu}(\alpha) = 0 \text{ or } \overline{\nu}(\beta) = 1\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}

    \item $\overline{\nu}(\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta) = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{iff } \overline{\nu}(\alpha) =  \overline{\nu}(\beta)\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$
\end{enumerate}
We also want the extention to be unique, that is

    if $\overline{\nu}(\alpha)=1$ (that is, provided that everery atom of $\alpha$ is in the domain of $\nu$). 
    We call $\alpha$ satisfiable\outernote{satisfiable} if there exists a TA that satisfies it.}
\defin{Tautological implication}{\outernote{taut. implication $\models$}\addAbbrev{taut.}{tautological}
    Let $\Sigma$ be a set of prop. sent. and $\alpha$ a prop. sent. then we say:
    $\Sigma$ tautologically imlies $\alpha$ if for all TA that satisfy $\Sigma$, $\alpha$ is also satisfied and we write $\Sigma\models \alpha$.
    If $\Sigma = \{\beta\}$, we simply write $\beta \models \alpha$ If $\Sigma = \varnothing$ then $\alpha$ is called a \graybf{tautology} and we write $\models \alpha$ instead of $\varnothing \models \alpha$ \\
    $\alpha, \beta$ are called \graybf{tautologically equivalent} iff $\alpha\models \beta$ and $\beta\models \alpha$, we then write $\alpha \sledom \models \beta$
}

\note{}{In other words, tautological implication $\Sigma\models \alpha$ means that you can not find a TA, that satisfy all members of $\Sigma$ but not $\alpha$.
    A tautology is satisfied by every TA. Suppose there is no TA that satisfies $\Sigma$, then we have $\Sigma \models \alpha$ for every prop. sent. $\alpha$}
\bsp{}{$\{\lnot A \lor B\} \sledom \models A \to B$ }
\note{}{In order to check if a prop. sent. is satisfiable we need to check $2^N$ TAs, where $N=\text{\# of atoms}$. It is unknown if this can be done by an algorithm in polynomial time. Answering this 
    would settle the debate whether $P=NP$}

However we can find a way to reduce satisfiability of an infinite set $\Sigma$ of prop. sent. to all finite subsets of $\Sigma$.
There later will be a more elementary proof of the compactness theorem, this proof is not part of the exam.
\thm{Compactness theorem}{Let $\Sigma$ be an infinite set of prop. sent. such that 
    \begin{equation}\tag{finite satisfiability}
        \forall \Sigma_0 \subseteq \Sigma, \Sigma_0 \ \text{finite}\  \exists \text{ TA satisfying every member of } \Sigma_0
    \end{equation}
    then there is a TA satsfying every member of $\Sigma$.}
{
    using topology: We have our infinite set of prop. sent. which satisfies above condition. One way to look at TA is as a sequence of $0$ and $1$.
    Let $\mathcal{A} = \{A_0, A_1,\dots\}$ be the set of all prop. atoms. We are going to identify the truth assignments on $\mathcal{A}$
    with elements in $\{0,1\}^\mathcal{A}\defeq \{f: \mathcal{A}\to \{0,1\}\}$ (the set of all TAs)
    This is a topological space with product topology, on which 
    the basic open sets (called cylinders) are:
    $ U\subseteq \{0,1\}^\mathcal{A}$ is a cylinder, such that $p_n(U) = \{0,1\}$for all but finite many $n$, where $p_n$ is the $n$-th projection.
    This means $U$ is a cylinder if the truth values of its elements are at finitely many places fixed, and are arbitrary on everything else.
    
%TODO correct proof
    Note: These basic open sets are also closed.
    The open sets are unions of basic open sets.
    The idea is to use Tychonoffs Theorem which tells us that $\{0,1\}^\mathcal{A}$ is compact. i.e.
    the intersection of a family of closed subsets w/ the finite intersection property (FIP) is non-empty.
    Finite intersection property means the intersection of finitely many sets is non-empty.

    For $\alpha \in \Sigma$ let $T_\alpha \subseteq \{0,1\}^\mathcal{A}$ be the set of TA that satisfy $\alpha$.
    This $T_\alpha$ is a finite union of cylinders, hence $T_\alpha$ is closed.
    For the family $\{T_\alpha: \alpha\in\Sigma\}$ of closed sets we have (FIP). Tychonoff tells us, 
    that $\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Sigma}{T_\alpha}\neq \varnothing$ so there is a TA satisfying $\Sigma$.}

\section{A parsing algorithm}\label{section_parsingalg}
To prove \ref{extendetTruthAss} We essentially need to show that we have enough parenthesis to make the reading of a prop. sent. unique.
That is given a TA $v$ there is at most one truth value we can assign to a prop. sent.
\addAbbrev{w/}{with}
\lemma{}{Every prop. sent. has the same number of left and right parenthesis.}{
    Let $M = \text{set of prop. sent. w/ \# left parenthesis = \# right parenthesis}$ and \\
    $PS = \text{set of all prop. sent.}$
    We have $M\subseteq PS$. Since atoms have no parenthesis, they are in $M$. we just need to show that
    $M$ is closed under the 5 construction operations.\\
    $\mathcal{E}_{\lnot} = (\lnot \alpha)$ \dots
}
\newpage
\lemma{}{No proper initial segment of a prop. sent. is itself a prop. sent.}{\label{NoPropIni}
    Let $\alpha = \alpha_1\alpha_2\dots \alpha_n$ be a prop. sent. By proper initial segment we understand $\beta = \alpha_1\dots \alpha_i$ for $1\leq i<n$.    
    We will prove that every proper initial segment has an excess of left parenthesis, then we use the previous lemma.
    Let $PS = \text{set of all prop. sent.}$ and \\
    $PF = \text{set of prop. sent. s.t. no proper initial segment has \# left parenthesis = \# right parenthesis}$, 
    we will prove that these sets are the same.\\
    Let $\alpha \in PF$. By induction on the fla. building operations
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Atoms: since the empty sequence is not a prop. sent. they have no proper initial segment.
        \item If the above is true for $\alpha, \beta$ then the proper initial segments of $(\lnot \alpha)$ are of the form
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[] $(\lnot \alpha$
            \item[] $(\lnot \alpha'$ where $\alpha'$ is a propper initial segment of $\alpha$
            \item[] $($ \qquad or
            \item[] $(\lnot$
        \end{itemize}
        Therefore $\mathcal{E}_\lnot$ preserves this property and 
        under $\mathcal{E}_\land, \mathcal{E}_\lor, \mathcal{E}_\to, \mathcal{E}_\leftrightarrow$ this is also the case.
    \end{itemize}
}
\subsubsection*{Parsing algorithm}
We now give a parsing algorithm procedure. For input we take some expression $\tau$ and the algorithm will determine if $\tau$ is a prop. sent.
If so, it will generate a unique construction tree (in form of a rooted tree) for $\tau$. (i.e. the construction tree gives us unique readability)
That there is a unique way to perform the algorithm is implied by \ref{NoPropIni}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[0.] create the root and label it $\tau$
    \item HALT if all leaves are labled w/ prop. atom and return: ``$\tau$ is a prop. sent.''
    \item select a leaf of the graph which is not labled w/ prop. atom
    \item if the first symbol of label under consideration is not a left parenthesis, then halt and return: ``$\tau$ is not a prop. sent.''
    \item if the second symbol of the label is ``$\lnot$'' then GOTO 6.
    \item scan the expression from left to right\\
    if we reach a proper initial segment of the form\addAbbrev{lp / rp}{left / right parenthesis} ``$(\beta$'' where $\# lp(\beta) = \#rp(\beta)$ and $\beta$ is followed by one of the five sentential connectives
    $\land,\lor,\to,\leftrightarrow$ and the remainder of the expression is of the form $\beta')$, where $\# lp(\beta') = \#rp(\beta')$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [Then:] create two child nodes (left,right) to the selected element and label them (left $\defeq \beta$, right $\defeq \beta'$) GOTO 1.
        \item [Else:] HALT and return ``$\tau$ is not a prop. sent.''
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item if the expression is of the form $(\lnot \beta)$ where $\# lp(\beta) = \#rp(\beta)$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [Then:] construct one childnode and label it $\beta$ and GOTO 1.
        \item [Else:] HALT and return: ``$\tau$ is not a prop. sent.''
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\bsp{}{The parsing algorithm applied to $((\lnot (A_1\to A_2))\lor A_3)$ returns the following construction tree.

}
\subsection*{Correctness of the parsing algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The algorithm always halts, because a child's label is shorter than the label of a parent.
    \item If the algorithm halts with the conclusion that $\tau$ is a prop. sent. 
    then we can prove inductively (starting from the leaves) that each label is a prop. sent
    \item Unique way to make choices in the algorithm: in particular $\beta, \beta'$ in step 5.
    If there was a shorter choice for $\beta$ it would be a proper initial segment of $\beta$ but such prop. sent. cannot exist.
    (This also works under the assumption that a longer choice exists).
    \item rejections are made correctly
\end{itemize}



Back to proving the existence and uniqueness of $\overline{\nu}$ in \ref{ThrmUniqueExt}.
Let $\alpha$ be a prop. sent. of $\overline{S}$. We apply the parsing algorithm to $\alpha$ to get a unique construction tree
For the leaves, use $\nu$ go get the truth values then work our way up using the conditions (1-6) in \ref{TAConditions}.

\section{Induction and recursion}
\subsubsection*{Generalization of induction principle:}
Let $U$ be a set and $B\subseteq U$ our initial set.
$\mathcal{F} = \{f,g\}$ a class of functions containing just $f$ and $g$, where $$f:U\times U\to U, \qquad g: U\to U$$
We want to construct the smallest subset $C\subseteq U$ such that $B\subseteq C$ and $C$ is closed under all elements of $\mathcal{F}$.
\defin{Closedness, Inductiveness}{ We say $\mathcal{S}\subseteq U$ is

Another is from bottom up: We call $C_1 \defeq B$, 
$$C_i \defeq C_{i-1} \cup \{f(x,y) : x,y\in C_{i-1}\}\cup \{g(x) : x\in C_{i-1}\}$$

    $S$ is inductive, so $C\subseteq S$.

Question: under what conditions do we get ``generalized unique readability?''
The goal would be to define a function on $C$ recursively i.e. to have rules for computing $\overline{h}(x)$ for $x\in B$
with some rules of computing $\overline{h}(f(x,y))$ and $\overline{h}(g(x))$ from $\overline{h}(x)$ and $\overline{h}(y)$.

        also $x\notin \rng (f|_{C^2})$ and $x\notin \rng (g|_C)$
        \item $x,y \in \mathcal{S}$
        We want $f(x,y),g(x)\in S$\\
        there are $v_1,v_2$ acceptable s.t. $f(x,y)\in \dom(v_1)\cap \dom(v_2)$
    \end{itemize}
\end{claimproof}
\textbf{Claim 2:} $\overline{h}$ is acceptable.
\begin{claimproof}
    $\overline{h}: C \rightharpoonup V$ by definition.
    if $x\in B\cap \dom \overline{h}$ then there is a $v$ acceptable, s.t. $x\in dom(v)$
    then $\overline{h}(x) = v(x)=h(x)$
    if $f(x,y)\in \dom \overline{h}$ then $f(x,y)\in \dom (v)$ form some $v$ acceptable.
    Hence $x,y\in \dom(v)$ and therefore $x,y\in\dom (\overline{h})$
    and we have 
    $$\overline{h}(f(x,y)) = v(f(x,y)) = F(v(x),v(y)) = F(\overline{h}(x),\overline{h}(y))$$
\end{claimproof}
\textbf{Claim 3:} The domain of $\overline{h}$ equals $C$. 
\begin{claimproof}
    it is enough to show that the domain of $\overline{h}$ is inductive. 
    $B\subseteq\dom (\overline{h})$ bc. $B\subseteq\dom (h)$ where $h$ is acceptable.
    Now we need to show closure under $f,g$. suppose $x',y'\in\dom (\overline{h})$ then $x'\in\dom (v_1)$ 
    for some acceptable $v_i$ lets assume $f(x',y')\notin\dom (\overline{h})$
    then we extend $\overline{h}$ to a function with the same graph as $\overline{h}$.
    Then
    $\varGamma \cup \{(f(x',y'),F(\overline{x'},\overline{y'}))\}$ 
    is the graph of an acceptable function.
\end{claimproof}
\textbf{Claim 4:$\overline{h}$ is uniquely constructed}
\begin{claimproof}
    Suppose both $\overline{h},\overline{\overline{h}}$ work, we schow that $S=\{x\in C: \overline{h}(x)=\overline{\overline{h}}(x)\}$ is the whole set $C$.
    it is enough to show that $S$ is inductive.
    Let $x\in B$ then $\overline{h}(x) = h(x) = \overline{\overline{h}}(x)$.
Then for $x,y\in S$ 
\[\overline{h}(f(x,y)) = F(\overline{h}(x),\overline{h}(y))=  F(\overline{\overline{h}}(x),\overline{\overline{h}}(y))=\overline{\overline{h}}(f(x,y)) \]
\[\overline{h}(g(x)) = G(\overline{h}(x))=  G(\overline{\overline{h}}(x))=\overline{\overline{h}}(g(x)) \]
and $f(x,y),g(x)\in S$, therefore $S$ is inductive.
\end{claimproof}

    Let $\Sigma$ be a finitely satisfiable set of prop. sent. Outline of the proof:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item extend $\Sigma$ to a maximal finitely satisfiable set $\Delta$ of prop. sent.
        \item construct a thruth assigment using $\Delta$
    \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Claim:} $\Delta_n$ is finitely satisfiable for each $n$
        \begin{claimproof}
            By regular induction over $n$. $\Delta_0$ is finitely satisfiable. Let us assume $\Delta_n$ is finitely satisfiable.
            If $\Delta_{n+1} = \Delta_n\cup \{\alpha_{n+1}\}$ then we are finished. 
            Otherwise let $\Delta' \subseteq \Delta_n$ be a finite subset that $\Delta' \cup \{\alpha_{n+1}\}$ is not satisfiable.
            It holds $\Delta' \models \lnot \alpha_{n+1}$.
            Let us assume that $\Delta_n\cup \{\lnot\alpha_{n+1}\}$ is not finitely satisfiable. 
            Then there exists a finite subset $\Delta'' \subseteq \Delta_n $ such that $\Delta'' \cup \{\lnot\alpha_{n+1}\}$ is not satisfiable.
            It therefore holds $\Delta'' \models \alpha_{n+1}$
            But $\Delta'\cup \Delta''$ is a finite subset of $\Delta_n$ and by above observations $\Delta'\cup \Delta''\models \alpha_{n+1}$ and $\Delta'\cup \Delta''\models \lnot \alpha_{n+1}$
            A contradiction to the assumption that $\Delta_n$ is finitely satisfiable.
